## Non-Supported Trigger Methods
1. Sending SMS when an item is created
    - The `new item` created does not have a `phone` field value upon creation.
    - `Workaround` would be to set up an automation recipe: `When Column Changes, Send SMS to Phone from Your Business Name` and manually update the phone column after new item is created.
2. Sending to `subitems` is not supported at the moment

## Custom Date Time format
Sometimes you may want to display a different format for your date time column in your SMS sent using Automation, you can do it by specifying your desired format in the **Update API Credentials Page**
### Date Formats
- `YYYY`: 4-digit year `'2019'`
- `YY`: 2-digit year `'19'`
- `MMMM`: Full-length month `'June'`
- `MMM`: 3 character month `'Jun'`
- `MM`: Month of the year, zero-padded `'06'`
- `M`: Month of the year `'6'`
- `DD`: Day of the month, zero-padded `'01'`
- `D`: Day of the month `'1'`
- `Do`: Day of the month with numeric ordinal contraction `'1st'`

### Time Format
- `HH`: hour of day from 0-24, zero-padded, `'14'`
- `H`: hour of day from 0-24, `'14'`
- `hh`: hour of day on 12-hour clock, zero-padded, `'02'`
- `h`: hour of the day on 12 hour clock, `'2'`
- `mm`: minute, zero-padded, `'04'`
- `m`: minute, `'4'`
- `ss`: second, zero-padded
- `s`: second
- `A`: `'AM'` or `'PM'`
- `a`: `'am'` or `'pm'`

### Example
Below is an example how you can combine both Date & Time format to create a customized date time format.
|Value|Result|
|---|---|
|  `ddd, YYYY MMM DD, h:mm A` | Wed, 2022 Aug 10, 9:32 AM  |
| `MMMM d, YYYY HH:mm`  |  August 3, 2022 09:32 |
