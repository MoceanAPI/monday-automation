## Non-Supported Trigger Methods
1. Sending SMS when an item is created
    - The `new item` created does not have a `phone` field value upon creation.
    - `Workaround` would be to set up an automation recipe: `When Column Changes, Send SMS to Phone from Your Business Name` and manually update the phone column after new item is created.
2. Sending to `subitems` is not supported at the moment

## Notifications and Updates in monday.com
If you'd like to disable receiving notifications and updates in monday.com whenever an automated SMS is triggered, you can configure it in the **Update API Credentials Page**

1. First navigate to `MoceanAPI - Send SMS app` or `MoceanAPI - SMS Broadcast app`.

2. Then click on the `Update API Credentials Link`. You can then configure whether you'd like to receive notifications in monday.com for every `automated` SMS sent

### Date Formats

### Time Format
- `HH`: hour of day from 0-24, zero-padded, `'14'`
- `H`: hour of day from 0-24, `'14'`
- `hh`: hour of day on 12-hour clock, zero-padded, `'02'`
- `h`: hour of the day on 12 hour clock, `'2'`

| `MMMM d, YYYY HH:mm`  |  August 3, 2022 09:32 |

## Country Setting
Sometimes your data might not include a country code for the phone number, you can specify the country setting and we will automatically convert the number to the equivalent of your chosen country code. 
For eg: the number `0123456789` will be converted to `60123456789` for the country `Malaysia (MY)`

**Configure this setting if you only send to one country and the phone number doesn't have a prepended country code**

**We will always prioritize the country code we get from your monday.com item**

## Voice Call
Contact us [here](mailto:sales@moceanapi.com) to setup your account for voice call capability.

### Virtual Number
By default, the `Number` we use to call your recipient is: `63001` which may be identified as `Spam  number` when your recipient receive the call.
To avoid this and get better answering chance, we suggest you to buy a virtual number from us [here](https://moceanapi.github.io/monday-two-way/#buy-a-virtual-number)

After you've bought your virtual number, you can select the virtual number in your `automation recipe`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24620178/226274870-c6ffa97a-6db0-446b-85b1-be775199782f.png)

### Voice Recording
If you've decided to send a **Voice Recording** instead of a **Text To Speech**, we have automation recipe that supports this. You will need to input the `Recording Link`

For the `Recording Link` input, you will need to supply a `Direct Link` to  the recording like below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24620178/226282397-4126e678-a1f1-4a66-9339-478e0640a458.png)
